# A certain famous system of differential equations can be approximated by 
# a system of difference equations that looks like this:
#    x(i + 1) = x(i) + s(y(i) - x(i)) dt           (4.1)
#    y(i + 1) = y(i) + [x(i)(r - z(i)) - y(i)] dt  (4.2)
#    z(i + 1) = z(i) + (x(i)y(i) - bz(i)) dt       (4.3)

# Write a script that computes the first 10 elements of the sequences X, Y
# and Z and stores them in vectors named X, Y and Z.
# Use the initial values X(1) = 1, Y(1) = 2 and Z(1) = 3, with values 
# s = 10, b = 8/3 and r = 28, and with time step dt = 0.01.

# Read the documentation for 'plot3' and 'comet3' and plot the results in 3
# dimensions.

# Once the code is working, use semicolons to suppress the output and then
# run the program with sequence length 100, 1000 and 10000.

# Run the program again with different starting conditions. 
# What effect does it have on the result?

# Run the program with different values for s, b and r and see if you can
# get a sense of how each variable affects the system.
