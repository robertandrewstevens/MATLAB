# Exercise 3.2
# MATLAB script refactored into Python (via R)

# Modify car loop so that each time through the loop it plots the value of a 
# versus the value of i.

# Once you get that working, modify it so it plots the values of a with red 
# circles and the values of b with blue diamonds.

# One more thing: if you use hold on to prevent MATLAB from clearing the figure, 
# you might want to clear the figure yourself, from time to time, with the 
# command clf.
