# Physical Modeling in MATLAB by Allen B. Downey
# Chapter 3:  Loops
# Exercise 3.1
# MATLAB script refactored into Pyton (via R)

# Create a script named car_loop that uses a for loop to run car update 52 times.
# Remember that before you run car_update, you have to assign values to a and b. 
# For this exercise, start with the values a = 150 and b = 150.

# If everything goes smoothly, your script will display a long stream of numbers 
# on the screen. 
# But it is probably too long to fit, and even if it fit, it would be hard to 
# interpret. 
# A graph would be much better!
