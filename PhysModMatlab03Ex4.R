# Physical Modeling in MATLAB by Allen B. Downey
# Chapter 3:  Loops
# Exercise 3.4
# MATLAB script refactored into R

# This example computes the terms of the series directly; as an exercise, 
# write a script named series that computes the same sum by computing the 
# elements recurrently. 
# You will have to be careful about where you start and stop the loop.
