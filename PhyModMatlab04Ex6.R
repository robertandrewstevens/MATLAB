# MATLAB script refactored into R

# The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, Fn+1/Fn, converges
# to a constant value as n increases. 
# Write a script that computes a vector with the first n elements of a 
# Fibonacci sequence (assuming that the variable n is defined), 
# and then computes a new vector that contains the ratios of consecutive
# Fibonacci numbers.
# Plot this vector to see if it seems to converge. 
# What value does it converge on?

n <- 10
F <- rep(NA, n) # initialize

F[1] <- 1
F[2] <- 1
for(i in 1:(n - 2)) {
  F[i + 2] <- F[i + 1] + F[i]
}

ratio <- rep(NA, n) # initialize
for(i in 1:(n - 1)) {
  ratio[i + 1] = F[i + 1]/F[i]
}

plot(ratio)
