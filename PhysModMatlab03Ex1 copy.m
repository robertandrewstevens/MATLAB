% Physical Modeling in MATLAB by Allen B. Downey
% Chapter 3:  Loops
% Exercise 3.1

% Create a script named car_loop that uses a for loop to run car update 52 times.
% Remember that before you run car_update, you have to assign values to a and b. 
% For this exercise, start with the values a = 150 and b = 150.

% If everything goes smoothly, your script will display a long stream of numbers 
% on the screen. 
% But it is probably too long to fit, and even if it fit, it would be hard to 
% interpret. 
% A graph would be much better!
